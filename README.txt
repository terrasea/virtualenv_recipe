I created this when I first came across buildout.  I was looking for a solution which would allow me to use virtualenv, install packages into this virtualenv, then use this virtualenv to run my buildout script.  At the time, which was a year ago, there were no solutions around that worked, that allowed me to do this.  I spent many hours, cursing the names of the buildout and virtualenv developers, to create this.

Anyway here it is.  I will get around to writing instructions on how to use it later when I have time.
